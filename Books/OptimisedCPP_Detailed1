// C++ programmers should leave memory handluing to containers and smart pointers, and not rely on manual memory handling

// destruction of objects is deterministic in C++, we can know exactly when an object is being destroyed

// internally, a reference is a pointer that is not allowed to be null or repointed, therefore no copying is involved when passing it to a function

// essential c++ techniques

// use auto often, improves readability
// remember that auto can include const aswell

// decltype(auto) can be used when we don't know the return type of a generic function

// use auto for local variables
auto i = 0;
// auto z = std::mutex{};

// c++17 introduced guaranteed copy elision, so auto x = foo{} is the same as foo x{}, there's no copying of a temporary object anymore
// auto is also useful because uninitialised auto variables cannot compile

// a const reference, denoted by const auto&, has the ability to bind to anything. The original object cannot be mutated through such a reference
// const reference should be the default choice for objects that are potentially expensive to copy
// if the const reference is bound to a temporary object, the temporary object's lifetime will match the reference

void some_func(const std::string& a, const std::string& b)
{
	const auto& str = a + b;  // str will go out of scope at end of function, temporary object returned by a + b will be destroyed

// better to be explicit, use const auto& to denote a constant reference and use auto& to denote a mutable reference, which should only be used when you want to change an object

// auto&& or T&& is a forwarding referemce, also called a universial reference, it can bind to anything
/* It's important to note that auto&& and T&& are only forwarding
references if used in a function template where T is a template
parameter of that function template. Using the && syntax with
an explicit type, for example std::string&&, denotes an rvalue
reference and does not have the properties of a forwarding reference */

// by using the keyword const, we can inform the compiler about which objects are immutable. The compiler can then check that we don't try to mutate objects that aren't intended to be changed
// however, const initialised objects can still manipulate values that member functions point at

// resource acquisition and the rule of 5
// one of the basic concepts in C++ is that a class should completely handle its resources
// this means when a class is copied, moved, copy assigned or move assigned or destructed, the class should make sure its resources are handled accordingly
// the necessity of implementing these 5 functions is called the rule of 5
// how the rule of 5 can be implemented in a class handling an allocated resource:

class Buffer {
public:
	Buffer(const std::initializer_list<float>& values) : size_{ values.size() } {
		ptr_ = new float[values.size()];
		std::copy(values.begin(), values.end(),ptr_);
	}
	auto begin() const { return ptr_; };
	auto end() const { return ptr_ + size_; };
private:
	size_t size_{ 0 };
	float* ptr_{ nullptr };
};

// in this class, the handled resource is a block of memory allocated in the constructor of the buffer class
// copy constructor
Buffer::Buffer(const Buffer& other) : size_(other.size_)
{
	ptr_ = new float[size_];
	std::copy(other.ptr_, other.ptr_ + size_, ptr_);
}

// copy assignment
Buffer& Buffer::operator=(const Buffer& other) {
	delete[] ptr_;  // delete whatever ptr is currently pointing at
	ptr_ = new float[other.size_];
	size_ = other.size_;
	std::copy(other.ptr_, other.ptr_ + other.size_, ptr_);
	return *this;
}

// destructor
Buffer::~Buffer()
{
	delete[] ptr_;  // it is still valid to delete a nullptr
	ptr_ = nullptr;
}

// although a correct implementation of these three functions is all that is required for a class to handle its internal resources, there are two issues
// 1. unnecessary copies, such as returning a Buffer from a function (the entire array would need to be copied)
// 2. Resources that cannot be copied, what if we had a unique_ptr for example, or an std::thread

// the solution is move semantics
// in addition to the copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator, we can add a move-constructor and move-assignment operator
// instead of taking const reference&, they must take rvalue references &&
// the && modifier indicates the parameter is an object we intend to move from instead of copying
// whereas the copy() function copies an object, the move equivalents move resources from one object to another, freeing the moved-from object from the resource

// move assignment and move constructor functions can be marked as noexcept, they won't work if they're not
// we can make these noexcept becaue they do not allocate memory or do something that may throw exceptions, unlike copy versions

// move constructor
Buffer::Buffer(Buffer&& other) noexcept : size_(other.size_), ptr_(other.ptr_)
{
	other.ptr_ = nullptr;
	other.size_ = 0;
}

// move assignment
Buffer& Buffer::operator=(Buffer&& other) noexcept {
	ptr_ = other.ptr_;
	size_ = other.size_;
	other.ptr_ = nullptr;
	other.size_ = 0;
	return *this;
}

// now when the compiler detects that we perform what seems to be a copy, such as returning a Buffer from a function, but the copied form isnt used anymore, it will utilise the no-throw move-constructor / move-assignkment operator instead of copying
// as the class has move semantics implemented explicitly, the compiler handles this automatically
/* Do not forget to mark your move-constructors and move-assignment 
operators as noexcept (unless they might throw an exception, of 
course). Not marking them noexcept prevents standard library 
containers and algorithms from utilizing them, instead resorting to 
using a regular copy/assignment under certain conditions. */

// the compiler is allowed to nove objects instead of copying when the object can be categorised as an rvalue.
// an rvalue is an object that is not tied to a named variable, either because its coming straight out of a function or because its been made an rvalue by using std::move()

// The object returned by make_buffer is not tied to a variable
x = make_buffer(); // move-assigned
// The variable "x" is passed into std::move()
y = std::move(x); // move-assigned

	auto t = std::set<std::string>{};

	auto i = 0;
	const auto foo = Foo(&i);
	foo.set_ptr_val(42);  // this works because the pointer itself is not changing, it remains const. Only the value it points to is changing.
	// to prevent this, a wrapper called std::experimental::propagate_const has been added to the standard library which applies to pointers

	// without move semantics, the advantages of value based semantics would be lost since we'd have to perform redundant deep cloning operations with high performance costs and error prone swap operations

	// when copying an object handling a resource, a new resource needs to be allocated, and the resource from teh source object needs to be copied so that the two objects are completely seperated
	// allocation and copying are slow, and in many cases, teh source object is not needed anymore. The compiler can detect cases like this and can instead perform a move operation

	// with move semantics, the destintion object steals teh resource straight from the source object, and the source object is reset, its very similar to swapping except that the moved from object does not have to recieve the resources from the moved to object

	std::vector<int>* a_v = new std::vector<int>{ 1,2,3,4,5 };

	std::vector<int>* b_v = new std::vector<int>{ 5,6,7,8,9 };

	std::swap(a_v, b_v);  // now a points to b's vector and b to a's

	for (auto& i : *a_v) {
		std::cout << i << "\n";
	}

	auto c = std::move(a_v);  // resources from a_v are moved into c, vector pointed to by c is move constructed
	for (auto& i : *c) {
		std::cout << i << "\n";
	}

	// a is now reset, it's still in a valid state, and can potentially be reset but its up to us to implement this in the objects move constructor
	// moving objects only makes sense if the object owns a resource of some sort ( commonly heap allocated memory)
	// if all data is contained within the object itself rather than heap memory, its more efficient to just copy it
