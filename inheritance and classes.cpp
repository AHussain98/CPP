# include <iostream>

// programmers often work with entities which are related or represent similar concepts
// a class hierarchy can express these relationships, making it easier for related classes to reuse code
// an example is input streams, istream is a basic input stream from which specialised ifstreams and istringstream are derived
// the class at the top of the hierarchy represents the most general or most basic veriosn, this is known as teh base class (istream for example for input streams)
// classes below are known as derived classes or subclasses, they inherit form the base class, they are more specialized or enhanced versions of the base class
// ifstreama nd istringstream derive from istream
// relationship between classes at different levels in the hierarchy is called inheritance
// inheritance models an is-a type of relationship between classes
// istringstream is a kind of istream

// In that case, if no default base class constructor can be found (or created by default), the compiler will display an error. The classes are then constructed in order from most base to most derived.
