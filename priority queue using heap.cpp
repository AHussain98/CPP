 //a priority queue performs operations on nodes in queue based on thier priority
 // this is implemented using a heap data structure
 // Heaps are a complete binary tree with a particular order property
 //complete binary tree is a tree where each level has the maximum amount of nodes it can have (two children for each node)
 //  Heap order property (for min heap): roots data must always be less than its chidlrens data, applies to every level
//  Max heap order property :  roots data must be larger than its children
//if an inserted node violates the order property, swap that node with its parent, continue up the chain, swapping as you go until it satisfies the order property
// STL priority queue is the implementation of the heap data structure
// A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
//1) Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

//2) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.
